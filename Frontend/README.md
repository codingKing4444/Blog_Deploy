# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




Add to GitHub 


git branch -M main
git push -u origin main



git init
Add your GitHub repository as a remote: If you haven't already done this, you need to add your GitHub repository as a remote. In the terminal, run:

git remote add origin <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository. You can find this URL on the GitHub page of your repository, typically under the "Clone or download" button.

git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Push your changes: Finally, push your committed changes to GitHub. You can do this from the Source Control view in VSCode or via the terminal using:

git push -u origin main



Add all files
git add .
git commit -m "Add new files and folder" 
git push -u origin main
